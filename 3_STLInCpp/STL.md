# ðŸ“š C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

## ðŸ”¥ What is STL?
STL = **Standard Template Library**  
Itâ€™s a collection of **ready-to-use classes and functions** for data structures and algorithms in C++.  

ðŸ‘‰ Instead of writing arrays, linked lists, sorting, searching from scratch â†’ you use STL.  
ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as a **toolbox** with efficient, well-tested components.

## ðŸ”‘ STL Terminology

- **Container** â†’ Objects that store data.  
  Example: `vector`, `list`, `set`, `map`.

- **Iterator** â†’ Like a pointer to traverse elements in containers.  

- **Algorithm** â†’ Predefined functions like sort(), find(), count().
They work with containers using iterators.

- **Functor** â†’ Object that acts like a function. (Useful for custom comparison in sorting, etc.)

```cpp
// Note => Before using STL don't forget to include this two important lines

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
```
